This is a primarily text based project I did to stay up to date with React and I'll likely add more to it as there is something new I want to try out.

The Star Wars API provides plenty of data to display and manipulate to your hearts content.

Things I may do....
  - Make it more mobile friendly
  - CSS in JS would be nice to try out
  - I'd like to come up with a way to display the relavant links for each subject (like related movies or planets etc)
  - The above would be easy to do if I implement some type of State management to model the data rather than a mix of setState and API calls on demand
